# Silicon Subprime vs To Big to Teraflop
## Theoretical Synergy: Minsky vs. The Four Ls

While [**Silicon Subprime**](https://github.com/roguetrainer/silicon-subprime) repository focuses on the *mechanics* of a crash, it operates within the broader *psychological* cycle modeled in our companion project, [**Too Big to Teraflop**](https://github.com/roguetrainer/too-big-to-teraflop).

### The Connection: Micro-Foundations of Minsky
Hyman Minsky’s "Financial Instability Hypothesis" argues that stability naturally leads to excess leverage. **Silicon Subprime** provides the mathematical micro-foundations for Minsky’s third and final stage: **Ponzi Finance**.

1.  **Hedge Finance (Safe):** Hyperscalers buying GPUs with cash (2022-2023).
2.  **Speculative Finance (Risky):** Neoclouds borrowing debt to buy GPUs, relying on rental cash flow to pay interest (2024).
3.  **Ponzi Finance (Silicon Subprime):** SPVs borrowing debt where the *principal* can only be repaid by refinancing or selling the asset—both of which are impossible if the asset depreciates.

### The Feedback Loop
* **Too Big to Teraflop** models the **Animal Spirits** that drive capital into the sector.
* **Silicon Subprime** models the **Transmission Mechanism** (Linkages) that turns that capital into systemic fragility.

The "Minsky Moment" occurs when the "Refinancing Wall" (L3) modeled in this repo is hit. The inability to roll over debt forces the fire sales that trigger the macro-collapse.

| Feature | Too Big to Teraflop (Minsky) | Silicon Subprime (Four Ls) |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Player Role** | Central Banker / Macro Manager | Risk Officer / Private Credit Fund |
| **Key Mechanic** | The Three Phases: Moving from Hedge → Speculative → Ponzi finance as the game progresses. | The Waterfall: Watching cash flow dry up before it hits the equity tranche (Game 3) or liquidity contagion (Game 1). |
| **The Villain** | Time & Complacency. The longer you survive, the riskier the market becomes automatically. | Network Topology. You die because someone else (a co-lender) panicked and pulled liquidity. |
| **Winning** | Managing the cycle to soften the landing ("Leaning against the wind"). | Surviving the specific "Refinancing Wall" in 2028 by hoarding cash. |
| **System View** | Top-Down: Looking at aggregate debt levels and animal spirits. | Bottom-Up: Looking at specific balance sheets and bilateral linkages. |
